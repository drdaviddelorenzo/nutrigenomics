path_safety.py — Input validation and path traversal prevention for Nutrigenomics

All file paths supplied by users are validated here before the rest of the pipeline
touches them. Three checks are enforced:

  1. Allowed extensions — only .txt, .csv, and .vcf are accepted as input.
  2. Path traversal prevention — resolved paths must stay within expected roots.
  3. Existence — the file must actually exist before processing begins.
